Variables:
  This code is a conditional that checks if the response is in a stacked array. If so, the response is stored in the API.
List:
  The complaints/feedback of the user get stored in a list and the code on the left shows how the reset works. When resetting, the responses variable becomes an empty list, clearing all previous data. 
Conditionals:
  This if statement in my code validates if the user provided any real feedback. If they provide no feedback and try to submit without a response when using the app, they will be alerted to provide some feedback.
API:
  The API is used to store the complaints from the workers to be accessed by any responder in the office. There will be alerts sent once the API has been modified with a new entry to show that feedback has been submitted.
